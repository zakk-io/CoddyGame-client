  * Dark background (near-black or deep gray) throughout.
  * Light-gray or white text for headings/labels; medium-gray for secondary text.
  * Accent colors used sparingly (e.g., bright blue for primary buttons, green/pink icons for board types).
  * Sans-serif font (e.g., Inter or Roboto), with clear typographic hierarchy.

---

## 2. Top Bar (Header)

## 4. Main Content Area

Occupies the central region to the right of the sidebar. Presents a list of “Boards in this team” along with filtering/sorting controls.

### 4.1. Section Header

* **Title**:

  * Text: “Boards in this team”
  * Style: 20 px–22 px, semi-bold, white or very light gray.
  * Positioned toward the top-left of the main content area, with generous padding (16 px–24 px).

### 4.2. Filter & Sort Controls (under the title)

* **Container Style**:

  * Horizontal bar (height \~48 px), same dark background as content but slightly lighter border or shadow on top.
  * Padding left/right: \~16 px. Elements spaced evenly or grouped logically.
* **Elements**:

  1. **Filter by Resource Type** *(new addition)*

     * Label: “Resource Type” (12 px–14 px, medium gray).

       * Clicking toggles ascending/descending arrow icon next to text.

  * On smaller screens, controls may wrap into multiple rows while preserving legibility.

### 4.3. Boards List (Rows)

* **Overall Style**:

  * Vertical list of rows.
  * Background: same dark gray as parent.
  * Each row height \~56 px–64 px; padding left/right \~16 px.
  * Row hover state: slightly lighter background overlay (e.g., #2A2A2A).

     * Color indicates board type:

       * Green rectangle icon for a generic blank board.

  5. **Action Menu** (three-dot vertical ellipsis)

     * Placed at the far-right edge of the row.
     * Clicking opens board-specific actions (e.g., Open, Share, Delete).

  * **“Create new” Button**:

    * Styled as a pill-shaped button with bright accent color (blue) and white text.
    * Positioned to the right of the empty message or centered below it.
    * (Omitted if red-marked, but conceptually present.)

---

## 6. Additional Notes for LLM-Friendly UI Modeling

1. **Fixed Elements**

   * Sidebar and top bar are sticky/fixed; they do not scroll with the main content.
   * Filters (under the “Boards in this team” header) remain visible at the top of the scrolling area.

2. **Accessibility & Labels**

   * Every icon has an accessible `aria-label` (e.g., Home, Recent, Starred, Spaces, Settings, Users, Filter by Resource Type, Sort by Last Opened).
   * Board rows have `role="button"` or similar, with clear focus outlines on keyboard navigation.

3. **Responsiveness**

   * On narrower viewports (< 800 px):

     * Sidebar collapses to icon-only mode (icons remain visible; labels hidden).
     * The filter bar wraps into two rows if insufficient width.
     * Board list may switch to a **card view**, where each board is a stacked card with icon at top, followed by title, subtext, last opened, owner, and a three-dot menu.

4. **Color Tokens & Spacing**

   * **Primary Background**: #121212 (dark)
   * **Secondary Background** (hover containers, cards): #1E1E1E or #2A2A2A
   * **Primary Text**: #FFFFFF or #F0F0F0
   * **Secondary Text**: #BBBBBB or #999999
   * **Accent Blue** (buttons/links): #3B82F6 (or brand-specific)
   * **Accent Green** (board icon): #10B981
   * **Accent Pink/Red** (notes icon): #EF4444
   * **Spacing**: Base unit 8 px; padding around containers 16 px or 24 px; margins between rows 12 px–16 px.

5. **Icons & Font**

   * Icon style: Minimal, line-based or simple filled SVG.
   * Font: Inter (body text 14 px, headings 20 px+), with distinct font weights for emphasis.

6. **Data-Driven Components**

   * **Filter Dropdowns**:

     * Populated dynamically from a predefined list of resource types (`["All", "Documents", "Codebase", "Whiteboard"]`) and owner statuses (`["Me", "Others", "Anyone"]`).
   * **Board Rows**:

     * Each row is bound to a data object with fields:

       * `iconType` (e.g., “blankBoard”, “notesBoard”),
       * `title`,
       * `modifiedBy`,
       * `modifiedDate` (e.g., “Today”, “May 22”),
       * `lastOpenedDate`,
       * `owner`,
       * `boardId` (for action menu).

7. **Interactions & Hover States**

   * **Sidebar**:

     * Hover on a nav item: highlight background to #2A2A2A; icon and text become brighter.
     * Active nav item: persistent highlight background (#373737) and brighter text/icon.
   * **Filter/Sort Controls**:

     * Hover on dropdown: border or background shifts to a lighter gray.
     * Selected dropdown items have a checkmark icon and background (#272727).
   * **Board Row**:

     * Hover: entire row background changes to #2A2A2A; cursor becomes pointer.
     * Clicking a row navigates to that board’s workspace.
   * **Action Menu (Three-dot)**:

     * Hover: dot icons turn brighter; clicking opens a small dark-themed popover with menu items (e.g., “Open”, “Share”, “Rename”, “Delete”).
